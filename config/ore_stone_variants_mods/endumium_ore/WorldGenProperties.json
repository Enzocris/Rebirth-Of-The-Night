//This file is not necessary. No field is necessary.
//The biome matcher arrays can be empty. Ores will just spawn everywhere, instead.
//If this file is not created, the ore will spawn under the same conditions as those of gold ore.

//These values are the same as those of emerald ore. Yes, 3 only spawns 1 block, but rarely 2.
